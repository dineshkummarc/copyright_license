**Derivation**

This is a master use and sync audio copyright license agreement. It was drafted for the `artist` as part of a multipart and multiparty deal for the production of theme music to be synced with streaming video.

**Scheme**

Beginning with the most subordinate contract and working backwards up the chain of relationships, the `artist` subcontracted with a `producer` for creation of the audio, and the `producer` in turn subcontracted with its `buyer` for the same, which originally contracted with the `programmer` that sought the audio for theme music over streaming video. This license was incorporated into the serial production contracts by reference and attached to them as an exhibit. The `artist` retained ownership of the copyright as an independent contractor, the product specifically not made as work for hire, but passed a limited license through the `producer` up to the `buyer` and `programmer` via their respective production contracts. The various licensees were specifically contemplated in subordinate licenses as third-party licensees.

**Design**

The license was designed for use in a multiparty arrangement. Transfer and assignment was limited to named and contemplated parties and affiliates. The licenses and production contracts were co-dependent, though the license would supersede in the event of conflict. Please note that therefore the license contains only a fraction of all provisions that defined the contractual nature of the relationships, and that some references in the license are without an included source. The arrangement allowed the client `artist` to achieve stated goals:

1. receive the work through cascading subcontracts;
2. retain ownership of the copyright and a measure of discretion over usage; and
3. pass a limited license up the cascade, but stop transfer at its end.

Attention was given to the disaggregation of component parts to treat the digital product at a granular level.

Generic party terms are indicated by `code` blinks.
